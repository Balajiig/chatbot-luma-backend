If you are feeling sad, lonely, or just "not okay," the most important thing to remember is that your feelings are valid. It is perfectly okay to not be okay.

In these moments, try to practice self-compassion. Speak to yourself with the same kindness and patience you would offer a good friend who was struggling.

This feeling is heavy, but it is also temporary. It will pass.

A simple, gentle action can help. Try taking three slow, deep breaths. Feel the air come in, and then feel it leave. Or, you can take a moment to stand up, stretch your arms to the sky, and gently move your body. Small acts of self-care like this are a way of being kind to your body and mind.
