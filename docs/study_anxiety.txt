Exam anxiety is a very real thing, and it's something many students and professionals face. That feeling of dread or "blanking out" is a common stress response.

A very effective way to manage this is the Pomodoro Technique. It helps make a huge task feel manageable.

Set a timer for 25 minutes and focus only on your work.

When the timer rings, take a 5-minute break. Get up, stretch, walk away from your desk.

After 3 or 4 "Pomodoros," take a longer break (15-30 minutes).

This technique makes the task less daunting, prevents burnout, and makes it easier to start. Also, remember to focus on your effort and process, not just the final outcome. Be kind to yourself.
