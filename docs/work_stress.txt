It's incredibly common for work, deadlines, or academic pressure to feel overwhelming. That feeling of stress is a real and heavy burden. When you feel that way, one thing you can try is an in-the-moment grounding technique.

Try the 5-4-3-2-1 method:

5: Name five things you can see right now.

4: Name four things you can feel (like your feet on the floor or a pen in your hand).

3: Name three things you can hear.

2: Name two things you can smell.

1: Name one thing you can taste.

This exercise helps pull your mind back to the present moment and away from worrying about the future. For large tasks that feel impossible, try breaking them down into the smallest possible steps. Just focus on the very next one, not the whole project.
